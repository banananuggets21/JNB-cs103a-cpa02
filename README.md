# CPA02 for CS103A: Yoshi Maker!

Have you ever played Mario? If so, you remember Yoshi, right? In that case, haven't you always wanted to design your own? Now you can with the Yoshi Maker! Yoshi Maker lets you customize your own Yoshi and, if you have no idea what a yoshi is, has a introductory video to explain it!
